        <h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>Looking to start your plant journey and not sure how to get started? Come on over to Lovey Dovey Plants, we got you covered from stems to leaf!
Our jouney started in 2021 when we found ourselves staying home and a sudden curiosity came over us as we looked at our small home collection of 2 plants. From a Lucky Bamboo and Money Tree plant we have expanded and created our own urban jungle in the heart of San Francisco. 
Through trial and error we learned which plants best survive indoors, how much sunlight is needed for these plants to thrive and how to best create a watering scheduele to ensure optimal root growth. 
Our care guides will help you to find which plant will best suit your home and lifestyle.
We have several plants sizes ranging from small to large that will serve as living decor for any decorative home style.
Types of Plants: Tropical Plants, Succulents, Terrariums & Air Plants.</p>
